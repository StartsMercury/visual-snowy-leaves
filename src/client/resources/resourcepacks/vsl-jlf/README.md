# Jungle Leaves Fix for Visual Snowy Leaves

Runtime modification of loaded textures affected the vanilla jungle leaves
texture such that the "fruit" colours are all "messed up". This resource pack
should fix that while still supporting the snowy variant.

For similar issues, block model faces may use a nonzero `tintindex`.
